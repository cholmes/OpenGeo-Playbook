Technical Challenges
--------------------

Overlaying the use cases laid out in :ref:`vision` on to the technical depth needed to truly solve them reveals most of them take quite a bit of work.  And there's no way OpenGeo could possibly build all the needed technology on its own.  But we're committed to getting open versions of all the tech needed.  We won't likely be the ones to build it all, but if there are critical pieces that are not open we will keep trying to find ways to get it built.  Each of the following sections riffs a bit on the tech approach we'd take, and then puts a list of more specific software pieces needed to make it happen.
