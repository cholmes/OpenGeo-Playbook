Foundations
============



This section focuses on the philosophical foundations of OpenGeo - our core beliefs, where we start from.  One can easily skip this, and for many this won't have much new information.  But it should reveal our biases in how we operate in the world, and it provides a basis for the way we make decisions about what to do and not do.  We don't believe in imposing these core values on others, we are not zealous about these beliefs.  But they are at the core of what we do, and we'll naturally work better with those who share the values.  And we do believe they point to the type of future we want to live in.
