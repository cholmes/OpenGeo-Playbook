OpenGeo Core

Ideal structure of OpenGeo 50 people, $10 million in revenue, starting new initiatives, incubating new opengeos, core software improvement, making money for partners, funding others for core development.

-> different because we employ people, from apache/osgeo.


Biz Team

5 Sales managers - US, South America, Europe, Mid-East/Africa, Asia/Pacific
 - Each mostly manages partners, builds networks, sets strategy
3 marketing - build brand, run events, write whitepapers do PR, marketing automation, advertising. Plus they have a big budget to outsource
2 biz dev, strategy, partner program



Outreach Team

5 on training / education - continually refining and adding material, making webinars, doing online trainings, and training trainers - so partners can run lots of trainings around the world.  Also reaching out to college courses and helping develop longer form course material.

2 on full time documentation, core open source docs, reference materials, interactive docs / recipes, new examples, tutorials.

5-8 Flex expert implementors / demo creators / partner trainers.  Team will be able to go out and make new cool geo apps.  Should be pros, able to take on any project, but team should always be taking on 'interns', getting more people as experts.  These guys should serve as second line support, always know the answer.  If they are between paid projects then they do pro bono mapping activities.  They also do all the support calls, so must have slack to handle that.

Core Devs - main responsibility is making beautiful code.  Are not very product driven, but take lots of input from product teams.  But also respond a lot to community needs, ensure great architecture and help plan for roadmaps from product teams.  Main goal is to always sure speed, scalability and flexibility in the core

2 Java (geoserver/gwc/geotools/jts)
1 C    (PostGIS, GEOS, gdal?)
3 Javascript (OpenLayers, GeoExt)
1 Python (GeoNode)

2-3 product teams of 3-6 each.  Suite and GeoNode.  Could be a cloud product, could be a new thing we incubate, could be a mobile thing.  If successful it may spin out, but leave 1-2 core devs behind at opengeo.  Each will have a a product manager, at least a couple devs, and balance of needed designers / web devs / etc.  Will contribute substantially to core code bases, putting down at lower levels whenever possible.  And can also leverage the core devs, count on deliverables from them, etc.  Each product will have clients, who fund it, whether by direct project work or by buying the final product.  Also 1-2 QA / testing people who are shared between product teams (and core devs can leverage them)

Designers - should have at least 2-3 dedicated designers.  Interaction, graphic, web, etc.  There may be dedicated ones on products, but also a pool setting the brand and image of OpenGeo as a whole.  Everything should look tight and have real interaction depth.  They will do continual user testing and refinement, work closely with each product, but also set deadlines across all.  Look to reuse metaphors and code.

Ops - 1 Sys admin, 1 accountant, 1 HR
