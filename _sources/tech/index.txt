Tech
=====

This section on technology is not meant to be a comprehensive roadmap, though in time it hopefully will link out to very detailed roadmap items.  Instead it is meant to present at a high level our goals for geospatial software.  These will change and be influenced by clients and users, but the intent of this is to lay out our current thinking on the technical challenges.  We doubt we'll be the ones to build all or even most of the things here, but these are the capabilities we want to exist in the world, and the point of our funding is to enable us to spend time on them.  This hopefully will be an evolving document, reflecting where the software is, what else is out there in the world, and who is involved in building it.  More operational documents will focus on what are immediate roadmaps are.
